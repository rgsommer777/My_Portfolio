# Updated Responsive Portfolio

Updated portfolio site using responsive design to ensure the application will render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Portfolio includes project 1 (My Dog Finder) ad additional assignments that showcase my development skills (Day Planner App and Weather Dashboard App).

# Approach
I refined the look and feel of the original repository and added links and screenshots to the Portfolio page. Additionally, I updated email, phone, LinkedIn and GitHub links and added a link to my resume.

In Git Hub, I updated my profile information including bio, contact and other info.

- index.html
- contact.html
- portfolio.html
- readme.md

I utilized the same navigation (nav section) based on Bootstrap Navbar for each page to keep the navigation consistent.

Deployed the app to my GitHub repository:<p></p>
